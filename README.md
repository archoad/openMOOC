# openMOOC

Parse a manifesto in Scorm2004 format and display modules and lessons.

# Usage

Just put the `index.php` on the same directory that the `imsmanifest.xml` file. By accessing the directory with your browser, you will see your mooc.

# Disclaimer

This development is specifically done to display the mooc of the french national security agency. However some features could be used to read other scorm2004 moocs.
